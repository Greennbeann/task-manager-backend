- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- Jakarta Validation
- Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven (or use the included `mvnw` wrapper)

### Running the App

./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## API Endpoints

## H2 Console

- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:tasksdb`
- User: `sa`
- Password: *(leave blank)*

## Running Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```
There is currently 1 unit test to cover the creation of a new task. More would be added in a full implementation.
## Notes

- The database is in-memory and resets on restart
- See frontend repo for a UI to interact with this API
